# SimpleWebApp
A very basic Node.js app to use as an example for workflows using GitHub Actions.

## Workflow status

## Workflows

The Node app can be deployed to Azure App Service with the included workflows, which are based on the default Actions. There are workflows that are triggered on the following events:
- Creating a PR.
- Adding a label during a PR.
- Merging into main.

There are two reusable workflows:
- build.yml which performs an npm install, build and test,
- deploy_to_azure.yml which deploys the web app to Azure App Service.

These are called by three calling workflows:

G(Push to main) -->|Triggers| H(deploy_prod.yml)

```

## Copilot for PRs

This repo has been enabled for Copilot for PRs, which is designed to reduce the effort involved in writing a pull request description. 

When you are ready to create a new pull request you can use Copilot to suggest parts of the pull request description. To do this, simply include the relevant markers in your text and they will be expanded for you automatically when you save the description. You can edit your description as much as you like, and whatever markers are present when you save it will be expanded automatically for you. Watch for the ðŸ‘€ :eyes: ðŸ‘€ reaction from Copilot to show that its working!

### Markers
copilot:all all the content, in one go.
copilot:summary a one-paragraph summary of the changes in the pull request.
copilot:walkthrough a detailed list of changes, including links to the relevant pieces of code.
copilot:poem a poem about the changes in the pull request.
